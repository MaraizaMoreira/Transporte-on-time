"Transporte On Time": An Inclusive, Real-Time Public Transportation Web Application

Transporte On Time is an intuitive web application designed to transform how users access public transportation information. Its primary goal is to provide real-time data on buses, trains, and subways, ensuring that everyone — including individuals with visual and hearing impairments — can plan their journeys with autonomy, accuracy, and confidence.

Key Features
Real-Time Route and Schedule Information
At the core of Transporte On Time is its ability to deliver up-to-date transportation data, including:

Arrival Times – Know exactly when your next bus, train, or metro will arrive.

Detailed Routes – View complete route maps to ensure you board the correct line.

Capacity and Delays – Receive updates on vehicle occupancy levels and delays, allowing you to adjust your travel plans accordingly.

All information is displayed clearly on individual service cards, giving users a concise overview of their trip status at a glance.

Accessibility for Users with Visual Impairments (Audio)
With a strong commitment to inclusion, the application incorporates advanced audio features:

Comprehensive Audio Descriptions – Users can activate an audio narration mode that automatically reads out essential interface information.

Individual Audio Controls – Each transport service card includes dedicated Play, Pause, and Stop buttons, enabling users with visual impairments to listen to specific route or schedule details at their own pace. This flexibility ensures that content is accessible and controllable, according to the user’s personal rhythm.

Accessibility for Users with Hearing Impairments (Captions)
To ensure equal access to information, Transporte On Time provides:

Clear Subtitles – When subtitles are enabled, a textual transcription of the audio content is displayed directly on each transport card. This complements visual elements and offers an alternative for users who are deaf or hard of hearing, or who simply prefer to read the information.

Application Benefits
Travel Efficiency – Users can plan more effective journeys, minimizing unnecessary waiting and avoiding unexpected delays, ultimately optimizing their time.

Enhanced Inclusion – The application breaks down accessibility barriers, making public transportation information available to a broader population, regardless of visual or auditory needs.

Improved User Experience – With a clean interface, intuitive navigation, and flexible audio controls, Transporte On Time delivers a smooth and user-friendly experience.

Empowerment and Autonomy – The platform empowers users to make well-informed travel decisions, supporting greater independence in navigating public transport systems.

Transporte On Time is more than a transportation timetable tool — it is a meaningful step toward digital inclusion, designed to simplify and enhance the commuting experience for all passengers.
